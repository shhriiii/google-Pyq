Round-1: Given a graph with n nodes, where one node is infected. You are given a start node. Return a vector of size n where each index indicates the shortest distance between start node to ith node of the graph.
Follow-Up: What if multiple nodes are infected in the given graph.

Round-2: Given a sorted array of integers, find the number of unique integers in the given array.
Follow-Up: If the number of unique integers in the array is very less than the size of the array, then find the mathematical formula for Time complexity.
